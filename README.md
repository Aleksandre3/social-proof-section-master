- Semantic HTML5 markup

- ### What I learned

- I am happy to share with you my third project with HTML/CSS ðŸš€ I'm a beginner in HTML/CSS, As I mentioned in the previous project, I was going to make a fully responsive small site. I made a responsive page for the first time, I think it turned out well

  There are big challenges ahead!!! ðŸš€ âœŠ

- ### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for responsive design. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web docs] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox and @media queries.
- I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
